# Corridor

A one dimensional corridor environment for Reinforcement Learning. The
goal is to get to the end (i.e. move right [length] number of times).

Inspired by [Ray's RLlib example
environment](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/custom_env.py)
and Sutton and Barto's examples (e.g. example 13.1 on page 323).


Compatible with [AgentOS](https://github.com/agentos-project/agentos).
